# DogWalk UI/UX Upgrade Blueprint

## Overview
This blueprint lays out a research-informed roadmap for transforming the current Walkies single-page experience into a cohesive DogWalk product that feels trustworthy, energetic, and companion-focused. It covers ten workstreams aligned with previously defined tasks and adds objectives, activities, dependencies, deliverables, metrics, and inspiration references. The plan assumes a cross-functional pod (product designer, front-end engineer, product strategist) working in two-week sprints.

## Research Highlights
- **Category benchmarks**
  - *Calm* and *Headspace*
    - **Color & gradients**: Rely on soft blues (#8AB6FF), lilac (#C1B7FF), and warm peach (#FFD5A8) gradient washes with generous opacity fades to convey calm.
    - **Typography & spacing**: Rounded sans-serifs (Circular, Gotham Rounded) paired with ample line height (~1.6) and 24px+ padding provide breathing room.
    - **Interaction patterns**: Progressive disclosure, gentle motion curves (ease-in-out 300ms), and supportive illustrations.
    - **DogWalk application**: Use this palette strategy for calming backgrounds in onboarding and care tips while keeping CTAs distinct; emulate their whitespace ratios for low-stress booking steps.
    - **Accessibility cues**: Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast on text over gradients; pair animations with reduced-motion fallbacks.
  - *Nike Run Club* and *Strava*
    - **Color & gradients**: Utilize vibrant accent colors (#FF6C00 Strava orange, #FFD800 NRC yellow) atop deep neutrals (#0D0D0D) to highlight performance stats.
    - **Typography & hierarchy**: Bold condensed headlines (Strava) and geometric sans body text (NRC) organize metrics with modular grids.
    - **Interaction patterns**: Live progress rings, activity cards with map thumbnails, and contextual coaching chips.
    - **DogWalk application**: Adapt these layouts for walker reliability stats, step counts, and neighborhood route cards; leverage accent colors for urgent states (late walk, rain alert) while staying within the new brand palette.
    - **Accessibility cues**: Ensure charts include numeric labels and colorblind-safe pairings (use combined color + icon states).
  - *Apple Weather* and *Dark Sky*
    - **Color & gradients**: Atmospheric layers using translucent cards, blur effects, and dynamic gradients (#3A4A6B midnight blue to #A0C6FF dawn sky).
    - **Typography & iconography**: SF Pro typography with thin-weight icons communicates data density without clutter.
    - **Interaction patterns**: Parallax scrolling, stacked cards with visual cues (rain dots, sun rays), and location-sensitive backgrounds.
    - **DogWalk application**: Translate these effects into neighborhood condition panels, walker availability cards, and hero headers with subtle glassmorphism referencing morning walks.
    - **Accessibility cues**: Maintain text legibility over imagery, provide textual descriptions of weather icons for screen readers.
- **User needs from 2023 Walkies discovery notes**
  - Safety confidence before handing off their dog.
  - Transparent real-time updates during walks.
  - Personalization for multi-dog households and special care requirements.
- **Business goals**
  - Increase new-user conversion (onboarding completion rate +15%).
  - Raise walk bookings per active user (+10%).
  - Improve retention via richer post-walk summaries and loyalty offerings.

- **Data model updates**: Align mock data in `assets/js/app.js` with expected backend schemas (walks, walkers, companions, messages, promotions).
- **Analytics & feedback**: Instrument key flows with event tracking (Mixpanel/GA) and in-app feedback prompts after walks.
- **Change management**: Stagger releases via feature flags (onboarding, booking, live tracking) to monitor impact before full rollout.

| Accessibility regression | Fails audit | Automate Axe tests; include accessibility sign-off in Definition of Done |

## Next Steps
1. Confirm brand assets, typography licenses, and iconography direction with stakeholders.
2. Align engineering resources on mapping and messaging infrastructure requirements.
3. Set up project tracking board (Jira/Linear) using workstreams as epics with sprint-level tickets.
4. Schedule weekly design-engineering critiques and bi-weekly stakeholder demos for feedback loops.
5. Kick off Sprint 1 with design token exploration and style guide documentation.
